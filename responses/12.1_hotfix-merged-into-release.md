## Deploying the fix

Master is the production branch, and the beginning of many new branches. We want to ensure that the same bug doesn't happen twice.

## Step 13: Merging into the master branch

Since you never deleted the release branch, you should be able to make a brand new pull request to the release branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Update the master branch

1. Open a pull request, with `master` as the base branch, and `release-v1.0` as the compare.
1. Include a basic descriptive request body and title.
1. Merge the pull request and delete your branch.
