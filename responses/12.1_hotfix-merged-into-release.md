## Deploying the fix

Master is the production branch, and the beginning of many new branches. We want to ensure that the same bug doesn't happen twice.

## Step 13: Merging into the master branch

Since the hotfix needs to make it to production immediately, we'll merge into the master branch. We'll tackle updating the release in the next step.
