## Release management

As you prepare for a future release, you'll need to organize more than the tasks and features. It's important to create a clear workflow for your team, and to make sure that the work remains organized.

There are several strategies for managing releases. Some teams might use long-lived branches, like `production`, `dev`, and `master`. Some teams use simple feature branches, releasing from the master branch.

No one strategy is better than another. We always recommend being intentional about branches and reducing long-lived branches whenever possible.

In this exercise, you'll create one long-lived branch per release version.

## Protected branches

Like the `master` branch, you can protect release branches. This means you can protect branches from force pushes or accidental deletion. This is already configured in this repository.

## Step 4: Creating a branch

Create a new release branch using a deliberate naming convention.

  - Warning: If naming doesn't match exactly, you'll run into unexpected errors later in the course.
