## Step 13: Backporting into the release branch

If you have previous release branches that are impacted by this bug, you might need to make a few retroactive pull requests. Generally, we do this by using [`git cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) to apply just those commits that should be backported.

In our case, no new changes have been merged into master since we shipped our hotfix, so we can merge the entire branch as is.
