Nice job! That should fix it.

## Avoiding deployed bugs

Avoiding bugs is difficult to do without a dedicated testing environment. With GitHub Pages, for example, code will only deploy from a master branch. We're only able to find bugs, then, if we see them live on the website, when they have the potential to affect countless users.

Depending on your set-up, this might be the same for your website, app, or software as well. Testing your code once it reaches master is a poor practice, and you should try to avoid it.

At GitHub, we specifically create special [deploy environments](https://githubengineering.com/deploying-branches-to-github-com/#deploy-environments) from unique branches, which allow us to test in production-esque environments without merging first.

You might also consider setting up [continuous integration](https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration), so that a series of standardized tests will run on every commit that you push to an open pull request. This should help you identify your bugs and errors before they even make it to a staging environment.

## Step 13: Merging into the master branch

Now that you've successfully merged into the release branch, let's apply our changes to the master branch. Since future version branches will originate from master, and since they'll eventually merge back to master for deployment, this ensures that the same bug doesn't happen twice.

If you have previous version branches that are impacted by this bug, you might need to make a few retroactive pull requests, or look into `git cherry-pick` for [your local environment](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) to carry changes over.

Since you never deleted the branch, you should be able to make a brand new pull request to master, using the same convention as before.

### :keyboard: Activity: Update the master branch

1. Open a pull request, with `master` as the base branch, and `release-v1.0` as the compare.
1. Include a basic descriptive request body and title
1. Merge the pull request
