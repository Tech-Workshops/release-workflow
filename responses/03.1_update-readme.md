## Add a feature

When crafting releases, there's usually a need to incorporate several changes into one release. In this case, while we won't have many changes, we will want to make at least one or two feature adjustments. Since we don't know of any bugs, we should be able to merge without worry.

For this example, let's make a few improvements to the game before merging it.

## Step 6: Adding a feature 

First, update the url in your README.md. Then I'll add some commits on your behalf that would warrant a version update.

Using our old pal the GitHub flow, create a brand new branch, make your update, and open a pull request with `release-v1.0` as your base branch.
