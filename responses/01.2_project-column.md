## Columns

Project boards are kanban style boards that can have a near unlimited number of columns. It's best to keep these minimal to stay focused.

For example, a common, simple template might look like this:

| To Do | In Progress | Completed |
|-------|-------------|-----------|

A more detailed version might look something like this:

| To Do | In Progress | Completed | Won't fix | Next version | Optional|
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|

Each project board's structure can be customized to fit you or your team's preferred style.

## Step 3: Create a project column

For this upcoming project, we'll be handling a few tasks. The first (this issue!) is to get organized, but we'll also want add a feature and fix some bugs that might pop up along the way.
