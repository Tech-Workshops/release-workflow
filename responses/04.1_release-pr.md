## Release branches and `master`

You should open a pull request between your release branch and master as early as possible, even though it might be open for a long time. Think of the original post of that pull request as a consolidated version of the project board that you previously opened.

The original post should:
- Include a brief description of the pull request
- Include a task list of expected features
- Propose a ship date

### Step 8: Open a release pull request

Let's make a new pull request, this time comparing the release branch to the master branch.

Here's a template for your original post, but feel free to use whatever works best for your strategy.

```
Title: Version 1.0 Release tracker

Body:
TL;DR: This branch includes planned version updates for our initial game launch.

Planned ðŸš¢ date: April 10, 2020

Features:
- [ ] Update the README.md
- [ ] Change the game text colors to green

Bug fixes:
None!
```

1. Open a pull request, with `master` as the base branch, and `release-v1.0` as the compare.
1. Include a detailed pull request body and title

Now that we've added our last features to the release branch, it's time for a code freeze. When we open this pull request, no new functionality should be added to our code. This means that any new feature work should be saved for the next commit, and our priority is bug testing and any necessary last minute fixes.

Since release branches typically stick around for awhile, we'll commit a few feature changes in the background that give our release a more detailed history.

To really make the version standout, we'll add some commits that changed the default text from green instead of white, in the spirit of a true alien invasion.

Because of the protected branches, this pull request cannot be merged until I get your approval. It's generally a good idea to make sure that branches, especially large ones like release branches, have the approval of your peers.
