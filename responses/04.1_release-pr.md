## Release branches and `master`

Now that we've added our last features to the release branch, it's time for a code freeze. When we open this pull request, no new functionality should be added to our code. This means that any new feature work should be saved for the next commit, and our priority is bug testing and any necessary last minute fixes.

To get that work started, let's make a new pull request, this time comparing the release branch to the master branch.

### Step 8: Review this pull request

Since release branches typically stick around for awhile, we'll commit a few feature changes in the background that give our release a more detailed history.

To really make the version standout, we'll add some commits that changed the default text from green instead of white, in the spirit of a true alien invasion.
