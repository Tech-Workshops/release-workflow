Great work! Heads up, [Release Drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter) doesn't work just out of the box.

If you use this in the future, you'll need to add `.github/release-drafter.yml` to your repository, which I did in the background on your behalf.

### Code freeze

Now that we've added our last features to the release branch, it's time for a code freeze. When we open this pull request, no new functionality should be added to our code. This means that any new feature work should be saved for the next commit, and our priority is bug testing and any necessary last minute fixes.


Because of the protected branches, this pull request cannot be merged until I get your approval. It's generally a good idea to make sure that branches, especially large ones like release branches, have the approval of your peers.
