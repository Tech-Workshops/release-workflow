## Merge

Nice work!

As you saw based on how we created the pull request, the GitHub flow is still an important strategy for working with your team. Even though you aren't merging back into master, and even though you have a long-lived version branch, it's a good idea to keep short-lived branches for quick feature additions and bug fixes.

## Step 7: Merge the feature into your release branch

Merge this pull request so that we can get our release pull request opened as early as possible.
