## Finalizing releases

It's important to be aware of the information what will be visible in that release. In the pre-release, the version and commit messages are visible.

### Semantic versioning

Semantic versioning is a formal convention for specifying compatibility. It uses a three-part version number: **major version**; **minor version**; and **patch**.  Version numbers  convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified. For example, versioning could be handled as follows:

| Code status  | Stage  | Rule  | Example version  |
|---|---|---|---|
| First release  | New product  | Start with 1.0.0  | 1.0.0  |
| Backward compatible fix  | Patch release  | Increment the third digit  | 1.0.1  |
| Backward compatible new feature  | Minor release  | Increment the middle digit and reset the last digit to zero  | 1.1.0  |
| Breaking updates | Major release | Increment the first digit and reset the middle and last digits to zero | 2.0.0 |
