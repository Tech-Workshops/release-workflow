## Automating releases

Now that our release branch is ready to be merged, we have two more steps to take.

First, let's make sure that we're set up to document the version changes for the users.

## Step 9: Adding a change log

We'll be using the Release Drafter GitHub app to draft our release notes as pull requests are merged.

The Release Drafter updates releases, so it requires write access to this repository. When you install the app, **don't add it to your entire GitHub account. Only install it on this repository.** [Release Drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter) doesn't work just out of the box. If you use this in the future, you'll need to add `.github/release-drafter.yml` to your repository. (This is already done in this repository.)

Note: For privacy reasons, we can't see what other apps have access to this repository, so we'll take your word for it.
