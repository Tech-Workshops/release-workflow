Great job opening this pull request!

Since release branches typically stick around for awhile, we created and merged a pull request for that last feature change in the background. This will give our release a more detailed history. To really make the version standout, we added some commits that changed the default text from green instead of white, in the spirit of a true alien invasion.

Several changes might get added to your release branch that you won't necessarily have a chance to review until they need a final pass. This is a common practice, and allows you to continue to ship code quickly without blockers.
