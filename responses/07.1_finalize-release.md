When finalizing a release, it's important to be aware of the information what will be visible in that release. If you recall the previous image from when you initially drafted your pre-release, the version and commit messages for that release are visible.

### Commit messages

When crafting your commit messages, keep in mind that they appear in several places, one being your releases. It's important to remember that you're crafting these commit messages for other people, as well as yourself, to read and understand throughout your project. If you're vague and non-descriptive, it can be very difficult to understand what is going on in that specific commit. If you want to write better commit messages, [Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) wrote a great article.

### Semantic versioning

Semantic versioning is a formal convention for specifying compatibility using a three-part version number: **major version**; **minor version**; and **patch**. Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next. For example, versioning could be handled as follows:

| Code status  | Stage  | Rule  | Example version  |
|---|---|---|---|
| First release  | New product  | Start with 1.0.0  | 1.0.0  |  
| Backward compatible fix  | Patch release  | Increment the third digit  | 1.0.1  |  
| Backward compatible new feature  | Minor release  | Increment the middle digit and reset the last digit to zero  | 1.1.0  |  
| Breaking updates | Major release | Increment the first digit and reset the middle and last digits to zero | 2.0.0 |
