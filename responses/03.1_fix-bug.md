## Fixing a bug

When crafting releases, there's usually a need to incorporate many changes into one release. In this case, while we won't have many changes, we will want to make at least one.

Tracking changes across multiple issues and pull requests can become burdensome. Luckily, GitHub Project boards are a place to keep track of progress.

Project boards are Kanban boards that can be customized to fit your needs, and augmented with automation.
