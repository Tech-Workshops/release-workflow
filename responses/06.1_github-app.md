Now that our release branch is about ready to be merged, let's create a changlog to keep track of our releases. Don't worry, we won't be maintaining this manually :wink:

## Using GitHub Apps

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub Apps, they are used to automate and improve your workflow and are built from other GitHub users like you! If you're looking to add a feature to your project, GitHub Apps are a great place to start. If you're interested in learning more about GitHub Apps, check out the [Getting started with GitHub Apps]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github-apps) course.

## Release Drafter GitHub app

We'll be using the Release Drafter GitHub app to draft our release notes into a changelog as pull requests are merged into master. Pretty cool!

Since the Release Drafter app updates your releases for you, it requires write access to this repository. When you install the app, **don't add it to your entire GitHub account. Only install it on this repository.**

### :keyboard: Activity: Install the Release Drafter GitHub app

1. Install the <a href="https://probot.github.io/apps/release-drafter/" target="_blank">Release Drafter GitHub app</a> to this repository **only**
1. Close this issue

Note: For privacy reasons, we can't see what other apps have access to this repository, so we'll take your word for it.
