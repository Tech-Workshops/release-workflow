## Keeping track

Creating a release package on GitHub might be easy, but it's only a piece of the puzzle. Releases often involve prioritized bug fixes, feature releases, and assorted tasks. How do you make sure you're keeping track? What happens if you want to save the most exciting features for a larger update?

## Step 2: Create a project board

On GitHub, the simplest way to keep track of several related issues is to make use of our basic project management tool, a GitHub project board.

Advanced versions of project management exist throughout the greater ecosystem, but we'll use our own to remain straightforward for this course.
