# Welcome

This repository will teach you about release workflows. By the end of this course, you'll have two versions of the classic arcade game, "Alien Invasion". Let's get started! If you'd like, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your Invasion game and see live updates. Just go to the **Settings** tab of this repository. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**. Select `master` as a **Source**, and click **Save**.

## The GitHub flow

The [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly.

This is great for projects working with a continuous deployment environment where there isn’t the concept of a “release” because every time a change or new feature is ready it’s pushed live immediately.

However, for most projects, the GitHub flow is just the start. To follow it up, you'll need to consider the concept of versions, and releases.

## Versions

Most software that we consume is versioned. Your phone, your favorite apps, software dependencies, your operating systems... all are downloaded and then updated as versions. You see this in a big way between installs like "Windows 8.1" to "Windows 10", or "macOS High Sierra" to "macOS Mojave".

At a specific time, updates to the codebase are frozen, tests are run on the existing project at that time, and developers are able to test the software for bugs before public consumption. After thorough testing and any last minute fixes, the code is bundled up as a release and sent out through public distribution channels where it can be installed by the end users.

## Step 1: Create a release

On GitHub, this is an incredibly easy process.

Since commits are essentially snapshots of an entire project history at a specific point in time, you can assign a tag to any commit or branch, and the repository will be immediately packaged as a release on GitHub.com. Before we start practicing a workflow for larger releases, let's create a tag and release right now.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a release for the current codebase

1. Go to the [**Releases** page]({{ releases }}) for this repository.
  - You can click the link above, or click the **Code** tab at the top of your repository. Then, find the navigation bar below the repository description, and click **0 releases**.
1. Click **Create a new release**.
1. In the field for _Tag version_, specify a number. In this case, use use **v0.9**. Keep the _Target_ as **master**.
1. Give the release a title, like "First beta release". If you'd like, you could also give the release a short description.
1. Select the checkbox next to **This is a pre-release**, since it is representing a beta version.
1. Click **Publish release**.
