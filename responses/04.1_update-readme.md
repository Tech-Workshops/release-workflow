## Add a feature

When crafting releases, there's usually a need to incorporate several changes into one update. We won't have many changes since this repository is designed to be a quick learning example, but will still want to make at least one or two feature adjustments.

For all releases you should plan features intentionally, and incomplete items should be placed on the project board as early as possible in the process.

Since we don't know of any bugs, we'll focus on a few features to update on our game before the version update.

- [ ] Update the README.md
- [ ] Change the text colors to green

## Step 6: Adding a feature

Your task will be to update the url in your README.md. I'll handle the other feature later.

Using our old pal the GitHub flow, create a brand new branch, make your update, and open a pull request with `release-v1.0` as your base branch.
