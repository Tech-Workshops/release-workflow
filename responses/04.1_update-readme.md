## Add a feature

Releases are usually made of many smaller changes.  This is a  practice repository, but will still make at least two feature adjustments.

Since we don't know of any bugs, we'll focus on a few features to update on our game before the version update.

- [ ] Update the README.md to point to the correct game URL
- [ ] Change the text colors to green

## Step 5: Adding a feature

First, update the url in your README.md.

Using the GitHub flow, make your update, and open a pull request with `release-v1.0` as your base branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Update the README.md

1. On a new branch, change the URL in the `README.md` to point to your own GitHub Pages site, `https://{{ username }}.github.io/release-based-workflow`
1. Open a pull request with `release-v1.0` as the `base` branch, and your new branch as `compare`.
