Now that your release is finalized, we have a confession to make... somewhere in our recent update, I made a mistake and introduced a bug. Instead of changing just the text colors to green, we changed the whole background.

_Heads up, sometimes GitHub Pages takes a few minutes to update. Your page might not immediately show the recent updates you've made._

"Hotfixes", or a quick fix to address a bug in software, are a normal part of development. Oftentimes you'll see application updates whose only description is "bug fixes".

## Step 12: Fixing the bug

When bugs come up after you release a version, you'll need to quickly address them. Since bug fixing in javascript is outside of our course scope, let's focus on the process for applying a fix to any programming environment.

We've already created this branch, pull request, and suggested a fix. Notice that the suggested change will be merged with the release branch, instead of directly to master. In a traditional work environment, your master branch might be several commits ahead by now, and you'll want to adjust your patch from the immediate point of failure, your release branch.

Apply the suggested change, and I'll talk through some additional strategies to avoid unexpected bugs in future workflows.
