## Release management

As you prepare for a future release, you'll need to organize more than just the tasks and features. Equally important is to create a clear branching workflow for your team, and to make sure that the work remains organized logically.

There are several strategies for managing releases. Some teams might use dozens of long-lived branches, like `production`, `dev`, `master`, `release-version`. Some teams don't use branching at all, cutting releases directly from the master branch and leaving tags in case they need to bugfix later.

For this workflow, we recommend that you create one long-lived branch per release version.

## Protected branches

When you create a release branch, it should generally be treated with the same care as a `master` branch. This means that, at minimum, it should be protected from force pushing or accidental deletion. We'll do this for you automatically for this course, but recommend that you [configure protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-protected-branches/) if you use this strategy on future projects.

## Step 5: Creating a branch

As you learned in the GitHub flow, create a new, long-lived branch from the **Code** tab using a deliberate naming convention.

Completion of this task resolves #2. Once I close this issue for you, our automated project board should move our "Organizing a release" task to completion.

All issues and pull requests can be closed [via keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).

Since this issue relates to organizing a release, I linked it to our previous issue with a direct mention (`#2`). Once this task is complete, I'll close the issue. When this issue closes, it will also close #2, due to the use of `close` and `resolves` as keywords. Assuming we set up automation on our project board correctly, an issue closure will move an "In Progress" issue that is closed to the "Done" column.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a branch

1. Create a new branch, and make sure it's titled `release-v1.0` (warning: If naming doesn't match exactly, you'll run into unexpected errors later in the course)
