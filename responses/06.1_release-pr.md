## Release branches and `master`

You should open a pull request between your release branch and master as early as possible, even though it might be open for a long time. Think of the original post of that pull request as a consolidated version of the project board that you previously opened.

The original post should:
- Include a brief description of the pull request
- Include a task list of expected features
- Propose a ship date

### Step 8: Open a release pull request

Let's make a new pull request, this time comparing the release branch to the master branch.

Here's a template for your original post, but feel free to use whatever works best for your strategy.

```
