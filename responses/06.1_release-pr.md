## Release branches and `master`

You should open a pull request between your release branch and master as early as possible. It might be open for a long time, and that's okay.  The pull request corresponds to the work in the project board.

The pull request description should:
- Include a brief description of the pull request
- Include a task list of expected features
- Propose a ship date
