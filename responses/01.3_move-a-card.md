## Triaging issues

Now that you've successfully added a column, let's learn about cards.

Generally, cards are just tasks that need to be completed. These can be existing issues or pull requests, or a stand-alone task that you add directly to the board. You can add external links, or even link across repositories if you're inclined.

In fact, if your release relates to issues or work taking place in another repository, you might want to create your project board at your organization level for seamlessly triage across multiple locations.

## Automation

You can also set up automation for specific behaviors. For example, if you want a card to automatically move to the "Done" column, you can set this behavior to happen automatically after an issue is closed. There are similar templates for "To Do" and "In Progress", which have to do with new issue creation, pull request approvals, or closure and re-opening.

## Step 4: Using cards

We're just about done getting organized. Let's triage this issue so that it's easy to find from our project board list, add it to our new board, and then move on to greater release management.
