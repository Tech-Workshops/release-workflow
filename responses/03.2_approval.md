## Merge

Nice work!

As you saw based on how we created the pull request, the GitHub flow is still an important strategy for working with your team. Even though you aren't merging back into master, and even though you have a long-lived version branch, it's a good idea to keep short-lived branches for quick feature additions and bug fixes.

## Step 7: Merge the feature into your release branch

I've added some additional commits to this pull request, to really make the version standout. In the spirit of a true alien invasion, I've changed the text to green instead of white.

Merge this pull request, and we'll get ready to package our next version.
