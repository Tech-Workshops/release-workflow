Great work! Heads up, [Release Drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter) doesn't work just out of the box.

If you use this in the future, you'll need to add `.github/release-drafter.yml` to your repository, which I did in the background on your behalf.

## Code freeze

Now that we've added our last features to the release branch and set up automated documentation, we're just about ready to merge!

An important part of release management is the "code freeze". The date for code freeze should be known, announced, and linked in the original post of this pull request far ahead of time. That means that, at this point, no new functionality should be added to the code. This means that any new feature work should be saved for the next commit, and the new priority is bug testing and any necessary last minute fixes.

Since code freeze is such an integral part of the workflow, it's important that you keep your release branches protected and limit access to direct commits, just like you would on master.

## Step 10: Merge

Because the master branch is protected, this pull request couldn't be merged until it received an approval. I've gone ahead and approved this one for you. It looks great!

It's generally a good idea to make sure that branches, especially large ones like release branches, have the approval of your peers. Go ahead and merge before we move onto our next steps.
