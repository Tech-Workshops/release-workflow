Maintaining a release based workflow for your project doesn't have to be a tedious and convoluted process. 

In this course, learn how releases are GitHub's way of packaging and providing software to your users based on a specific point in the history of your project. We'll walk you through creating a release branch that is built on the foundations of the GitHub Flow while giving you the benefits of a release-based workflow. 

As a result of taking this course, you'll be able to:

- create a release on GitHub based on a Git tag
- build a project board within your repository to mange your release
- create and commit changes on a release branch
- create a hot fix branch to fix a bug on the release branch
- install a Probot app to craft a changelog for your releases
