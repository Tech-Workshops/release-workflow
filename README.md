Maintaining a release-based workflow for your project doesn't have to be a tedious and convoluted process. Implementing a release-based workflow ensures that you are:

- in control of all changes introduced to your project
- keeping track of interdependent changes being incorporated as part of an intended release for your project

In this course, learn how releases are GitHub's way of packaging and providing software to your users based on a specific point in the history of your project. We'll walk you through creating a release branch that is built on the foundations of the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) while giving you the benefits of a release-based workflow.

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- create a release on GitHub based on a Git tag
- build a project board within your repository to manage your release
- create and commit changes on a release branch
- resolve bugs made after a release
- automate and better document your release changes
